Through this piece, I wanted to bring awareness to Congan child cobalt miners, whose well-being and health are exploited by the global demand for cobalt in lithium-ion batteries found in portable electronics, electric cars, and other technologies. This work depicts twelve flowers and the silhouette of an elephant. The flowers, eight irises, and four calla lilies are painted with cobalt blue pigment and bear the meaning of innocence, purity, beauty, and hope. Each iris represents 100 thousand children (800,000 total who work in state-run cobalt mines) and each calla lily represents ten thousand children (40,000 total who work in illegal cobalt mines). The integration of the elephant represents the mental and physical strength of child cobalt miners and how they are forced to forfeit their childhood to make a living. Finally, the negotiation between the black and white pigment on the canvas expresses the dehumanizing impacts of consumer greed on the lives of these child miners. 
While the use of technologies containing lithium-ion batteries is becoming increasingly common, the value that is placed on increasingly rapid development often overlooks its cost—the exploitation of children in third world countries. The research on child cobalt miners in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) for this work opened my eyes to the way we perpetuate the tech industry’s reliance on child labor through our regular consumption of portable electronic devices. As someone who, like many others, regularly uses cobalt-containing technologies such as laptops and cellphones, I believe that it is imperative to work towards developing sustainable practices around material sourcing and aim towards eliminating the use of cobalt in lithium-ion batteries. 

## shame

This piece explores the feeling of shame, bringing together the philosophical, psychological, emotional, and physical aspects of shame through western and eastern artistic media.
Emotions are not linear. We experience them in gradients as they spill out of the neat boundaries we set for ourselves. This uncontrolled aspect of emotion is represented through the spread of Sumi ink on rice paper. My experience of shame has reflected this process—often, my ego and confidence will be tainted by the feeling of shame. The way the ink spreads in this piece allows for gradients in shade, representing the spectrum that shame can be experienced and expressed. 
The body language of the subject in this piece indicates tension and fragility. The animal instinct when experiencing shame is to hide from the emotion that causes feelings of vulnerability. The subject remains in a compact form and is expressed through intentional lines, contrasting with the disorganized ink in the background. The skull represents humanity in all its imperfections, serving as a reminder of inevitable death. One can say that to be human means to feel emotions, however, the feeling of shame is heavy, so the simply depicted subject is poised to crumble at the weight of shame.  
Shame has been tied to human history since the beginning. The peacock is a symbol of pride, each eye at the end of its feather an eye of Argus, prideful Hera’s servant killed by Hermes. The peacock butterflies fall from the subject’s back like molted feathers, depicting a loss of pride. Butterflies themselves represent transformation and rebirth, however, strong feelings of shame can prevent positive change from happening. The subject’s ‘rejection’ of butterflies represents letting go of opportunities for change and clinging to the heavy emotion represented by the skull even under the threat of crumbling.

<p style="text-align: center;">*“We know ourselves to be part of mystery.
<br> It is unspeakable.
<br> It is everlasting.
<br> It is for keeps.”*
<br> Joy Harjo, For Keeps </p>

These lines in Joy Harjo’s poem "For Keeps" contextualize the concept of balance between the spiritual and physical worlds, individuality and ancestry, and tradition and modernity. It is often difficult to become someone influenced, but not captive to societal, cultural, and traditional norms. In this painting, I incorporated elements inspired by Korean culture to explore connections that we share to the natural world and my identity as a culmination of various aspects of myself. I used the imagery of a hand on my shoulder to represent the familial and ancestral influences on my actions shaped by history and bonds. The background for this work is composed of Sumi ink on rice paper and was created using traditional methods—the blending and gradation of the ink embodies the mixing of old and new values. The silhouette of the figures serves as a vessel for the influences which surround me, using lines to constantly negotiate between the subject matter and negative space, serving to promote dialogue between identity, nature, and society. The ethereal disintegration of hair into Magpie feathers and the fallen daenggi, or traditional Korean hair ribbon rejects Western and Eastern standards of beauty and femininity which are substituted with the Magpie’s symbolic meaning of dualism and freedom and its connection to the environment. As Harjo writes, “We know ourselves to be part of mystery.” Regardless of who we are, our connection with the earth, with the past and present, is for keeps.
